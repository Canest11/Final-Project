        <h3>The Importance of a Nutritious Breakfast for Children</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A Balanced Meal: Children should eat a breakfast that includes a variety of food groups to ensure that they get the nutrients they need to start the day. A balanced breakfast might include whole-grain bread or cereal, protein-rich foods such as eggs, cheese or yogurt, and some fresh fruit or vegetables.</li>

          <li>Limit Sugary Foods: Children should avoid sugary foods such as candy, pastries, and sugary cereals as they can lead to a quick energy boost followed by a crash, which can negatively impact their mood, focus, and overall health. Instead, opt for breakfasts that are low in sugar and high in complex carbohydrates, which will provide sustained energy throughout the morning.</li>

          <li>Encourage Hydration: Encourage children to drink water or low-fat milk as a part of their breakfast routine to stay hydrated and to support healthy bone development. Avoid sugary drinks such as sodas, fruit juices, or sweetened teas as they are high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems
